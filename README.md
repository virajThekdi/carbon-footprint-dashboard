Carbon Footprint & Sustainability Analytics Dashboard
Company: Verdemotion Automotive

Tagline: Driving Sustainable Mobility

 Project Overview

This project features a single-page, executive-ready Carbon Footprint Dashboard built in Power BI for an automotive manufacturing company.
The dashboard is intentionally designed as one complete page, ensuring that all critical sustainability KPIs and insights are visible at a glance without navigation.

This one-page design makes it ideal for leadership reviews, ESG reporting, and strategic decision-making.

Dashboard Objective

Provide a complete carbon footprint view on one page

Enable fast, data-driven sustainability decisions

Eliminate the need for multiple report pages

Deliver a clean, professional, real-world dashboard layout

Dashboard Structure (Single Page)

 Note:
This project contains ONLY ONE PAGE, and this page represents the final, complete dashboard.
